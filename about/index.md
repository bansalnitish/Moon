I am currently pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee][IITR].

I was born and raised in Bathinda, Punjab and did my schooling from [St. Joseph's Convent School][JOSEPH]. I am deeply into sports and to be particular love to play cricket and badminton. After school, I took the JEE exam and got an All India Rank of 499 and landed up in IIT Roorkee, a decision which I will never regret.

I am fluent in C, C++, JavaScript, AngularJS and Python.

Contact me on my [E-Mail][mail].
